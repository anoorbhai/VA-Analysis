Your task is to:
1) Identify the single most likely cause of death.
2) Provide the corresponding Number. The number must be exactly as listed in the list above e.g., `"234"` not `"12"`.
3) Estimate your confidence level in your answer as a percentage. 

If the information is insufficient to determine a cause of death, explicitly state that in the output.

Return ONE JSON object with EXACTLY these keys:
{
  "ID": "<the case id>",
  "CAUSE_SHORT": "<short english wording>",
  "Number": "<the corresponding number>",
  "CONFIDENCE": "<percentage confidence>"
}
Do not add other keys or text.
