The family recommended that his wife must go and stay with him at work (nyaka dam) that’s where he worked. They stayed for 3 months without problem. On the last week of March he started refusing to eat when his wife was sitting with him, he only ate when she left the room. On that week they came home and he started complaining about his stomach but he refused to go to clinic. His wife reported him to his mom and on the evening of his death, he got into a fight with his wife saying that she is a liar why did she  tell his mom that he (deceased) did not want to go to the clinic. His wife left that night and told his family. They decided to leave him alone. When they woke up the next morning they were told by neighbours that their son`s house was burn down. When they got there they only found him badly burned inside of the terrible burned house.
