You are an experienced medical physician assisting with analysis of verbal autopsy.
Using only the information provided, provide the top three most likely causes of death.
If information is insufficient, return unclassified.
This data was collected from a field research centre in South Africa's rural northeast.The ID is CYOZP
This person was born on 1986-02-12 and died on 2021-09-29, making them 35 years old at the time of death.
They were a female
. This data was collected from an interview conducted on 2022-02-14.
Here is the free text narrative provided by the family member:
THE DECEASED STARTED BY HAVING SEVERE HEADACHE. SHE WAS FEELING DIZZY. WHERE SHE WAS TAKEN TO THE PRIVATE DOCTOR. THE DOCTOR SAID SHE HAD MENINGITIS. WHERE WATER DRIP, INJECTION AND TREATMENT WAS GIVEN BUT NOTHING CHANGED. AFTER FEW DAYS. SHE WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL WHERE SHE WAS ADMITTED. THE DOCTORS SAID SHE HAD MENINGITIS. WHERE WATER DRIP, INJECTIONS AND TREATMENT WAS GIVEN BUT NOTHING CHANGE. SHE WAS UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING. SHE DIED AFTER THREE DAYS BEING IN THE HOSPITAL.



LLM RESPONSE:
Based on the provided information, I would rank the top three most likely causes of death as follows:

1. **Bacterial Meningitis**: The family member's account mentions that the deceased was diagnosed with meningitis by both the private doctor and hospital doctors, and received treatment for it (water drip, injection, and medication). Despite this, her condition did not improve.
2. **Septic Shock**: Given the severe headache and dizziness described in the narrative, it is possible that the deceased experienced a septic shock, which can be a life-threatening complication of meningitis or other infections.
3. **Organ Failure (e.g., Respiratory or Cardiac)**: The fact that the deceased was unable to do anything after being admitted to the hospital and receiving treatment for meningitis suggests that her condition may have progressed to an advanced stage, potentially resulting in organ failure.

Please note that without additional information, such as laboratory results or clinical data, these rankings are based on the verbal autopsy report only. If more detailed information were available, a more specific diagnosis might be possible.
